# Animated-CSS-cards

Small project to create some animated cards, focusing on CSS. Web Dev Simplified.

# Project Highlights:

In this project there is a focus on writing clean, functional CSS. Using different selectors, properties, and CSS variables.

## Interesting CSS tricks used to be noticed:

- nesting classes like: .card.card-header (so AND selector)
- using ">" to pick a direct child;
- using "+" to pick adjacent sibling; (specified classes)
